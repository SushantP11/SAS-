ABSTRACT :

The main problem faced by GRBS is to identify the set of Donors using data provided by another branch of GRBS situated in another state. The objective is to collect $100,000 for the flood relief fund. This is necessary as to meet the deadlines and provide immediate help to those effected in the cyclone. Hence, by Analysing the data and building a Logistic regression model, it becomes easy for the company to understand Donor characteristics and find the most probable Donors who will donate for the cause. This indirectly allows the resources to allocated in a efficient manner with minimal wastage of time and money
 

Using SAS we try to find the most probable donors.
